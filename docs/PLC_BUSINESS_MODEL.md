## Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Low Adoption of Code Generator (Pro Tier)

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (Pro tier is $499/mo)

**Mitigation:**
- Offer 7-day free trial of code generator
- Build trust with thorough verification (computer-use)
- Start with Basic/Plus tiers, upsell later
- Show ROI calculator (time saved vs. subscription cost)

### Risk 2: Enterprise Sales Cycle Too Long

**Likelihood:** High (enterprise deals take 6-12 months)
**Impact:** Medium (delays ARR growth)

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on B2C and B2B Individual in Year 1-2
- Use land-and-expand (start with small pilot, then expand)
- Offer proof-of-value pilots (90 days free)

### Risk 3: PLC Vendors Build Competing Tools

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (vendors have brand advantage)

**Mitigation:**
- Become their data provider (DAAS licensing)
- Multi-vendor support (vendors only support their own)
- Community-validated content (vendors can't replicate)
- Speed to market (launch before they react)

### Risk 4: Code Generation Liability

**Likelihood:** Low (user testing required)
**Impact:** High (safety-critical systems)

**Mitigation:**
- Require user verification of generated code
- Include prominent disclaimer (not certified for production)
- Add safety warnings to all generated code
- Liability insurance ($1M-$2M coverage)
