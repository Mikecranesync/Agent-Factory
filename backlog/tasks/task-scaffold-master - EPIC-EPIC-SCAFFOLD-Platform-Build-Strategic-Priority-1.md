## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
SCAFFOLD: Specification-driven autonomous code generation platform powered by Claude.

**Vision:**
User writes task spec in Backlog.md → SCAFFOLD orchestrator reads spec → Claude implements autonomously in isolated git worktree → Tests validate code → PR opens automatically → User reviews and merges → Backlog.md auto-updates to Done

**Why SCAFFOLD is Strategic Priority #1:**
- Fastest path to revenue (6 months vs 12-18 for RIVET/Friday)
- Lowest risk (uncontested market, proven demand)
- Funds everything else ($1M+ ARR enables RIVET, Friday, hiring)
- Validates all Agent Factory subsystems at scale

**Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-12: Secret Build + Recording (11 core build tasks + safety rails)
- Weeks 13-16: Content Production Automation (120+ tasks)
- Weeks 17-28: Sequential Content Release
- Week 29: Public Launch

**Revenue Potential:** $1M-$3.2M Year 1

This EPIC tracks all 144 SCAFFOLD tasks across 3 phases:
- Phase 1: 11 Core Build tasks (orchestrator, parser, executor, safety)
- Phase 2: 9 Validation tasks (test all subsystems at scale)
- Phase 3: 123 Content Production tasks (videos, blogs, tweets, thumbnails)

**Part of EPIC:**  (SCAFFOLD Platform Build)

**Strategic Context:** Strategic Priority #1, 12 weeks to MVP, $1M-$3.2M Year 1 revenue potential
