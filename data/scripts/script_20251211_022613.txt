[show title: Ladder Logic Fundamentals] [enthusiastic] Ready to level up your ladder logic fundamentals skills? Here's what you need to know.

[explanatory] Today we're covering Ladder Logic Fundamentals. This is based on official Allen Bradley documentation, so you're getting accurate, reliable information. I'll walk you through the exact steps you need to follow.

[show code: ladder_logic] Step 1: Open Studio 5000 software and create a new project. [pause] Step 2: Add a new ladder logic routine to the MainProgram. [pause] Step 3: Drag an XIC (Examine If Closed) instruction onto Rung 0. [pause] Step 4: Drag an OTE (Output Energize) instruction next to the XIC. [pause] Step 5: Assign tags to the instructions (e.g., Start_Button, Motor_Run). [pause] Step 6: Download the program to the controller and test. [show citation: 1756-um001-sample.pdf]
