The procedure then addresses potential servo tuning issues, suggesting adjustments to specific parameters that could resolve the error if the fault is related to servo performance under load conditions. The recommendation to test the system at a reduced speed initially is a prudent step to ensure that the adjustments are effective without imposing full operational stress on the system immediately. This step-by-step approach ensures that both mechanical and programming aspects are covered, reducing the risk of overlooking a potential cause of the fault code.\nMISSING_STEPS: none\nORDERING_ISSUES: none"
